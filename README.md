# x_-_a_xii_Weather
Project 2

This app is a collaborative effort of 4 people. We created a weather app which used multiple APIs in order to delivery a 
convenient way to see the weather conditions anywhere in the world. There is hourly, daily, and weekly weather information and a way to save
your favorite locations in a list. Everything is at the touch of a button using bottom navigation and you can easily switch from metric 
to imperial degree units using a button in the action bar of the app.

Includes:Clean Architecture, Design Pattern(MVVM), Unit Testing(Mockito), Exception Handling, Logging(Timber), and Monitoring(Crashlytics)
